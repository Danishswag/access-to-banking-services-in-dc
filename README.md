# Access to Banking Services in Washington D.C.
This repository holds all of the files used in my blog post [here](justjensen.co/access-to-banking-services-in-washington-d-c).

## Requirements and Use

I used QGIS and RStudio, although you can use whatever software you want to
visualize the GeoJSON files or analyze the CSV. In QGIS, I used the MMQGIS plugin,
although this is not necessary to open the project.

I also used Adobe's [Source Sans Pro font](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-sans-pro).
